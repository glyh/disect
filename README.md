## What?
In this repo I record all I know about the FOSS projects I list.
## Why?
1. So I can check them when I need them for my side projects.
2. I learn a lot: writing codes, reading codes, designing systems, etc. I recommend you to do so.
3. Make the barrier for newcomers to those FOSS project lower.
4. It's fun.
